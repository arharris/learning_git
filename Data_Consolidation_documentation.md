## Purpose
Here's where you would briefly describe the overall intent of the software, with a very generalized discussion of input and output. 

## Quick Instructions
I don't know about you, but I loathe finding a recipe online and having to read someone's life story before they tell me the recipe. Unless it is absolutely critical to the understanding of how to use the software, there should be basic instructions here, near the start of the documentation, of how to use the software in question. This section should contain enough information to successfully use the program, and if there are any key details which may trip up the user, explain those as well.

## Detailed Instructions
If the software merits it, here's where we have a more detailed set of instructions on how the software functions and how to use it. If there are multiple functions or options, here's where they would be explained.

## Inputs
Detail the necessary inputs to run the software. This could be input files, variable parameters that must be entered, or some other input to the program. Input file structure should be explained.

## Outputs
Detail the expected output of the software, and if necessary, any additiuonal information needed to interpret or use these outputs.+

# Verasol Data Consolidation
#### Version 2.0

## Purpose
This suite of scripts is designed to take the individual product testing results and consolidate them as an Rdata object. This Rdata object can be used as a pseudo-database for broader analysis.

## Quick Instructions
Currently, script must be implemented in an R instance (RStudio is ideal, but if you are comfortable with the base R GUI, that works as well). In the future, this may be updated to operate as a command line tool.
